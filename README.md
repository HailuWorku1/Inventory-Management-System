# Inventory-Management-System
This project is IMS for a Drug Store which is an application that helps to manage the stock, orders, and sales of drugs and medications in a retail pharmacy. It can also help to track the expiry dates, batch numbers, and storage conditions of the drugs, as well as generate reports and invoices for the customers and suppliers.
